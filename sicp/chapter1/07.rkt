; EXERCISE:
; An alternative strategy for implementing good-enough?
; is to watch how guess changes from one iteration to the next
; and to stop when the change is a very small fraction of the guess.
; Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind of end test.

;Modified good-enough? procedure
